## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#30475E) to convey professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#D6D5A8) to provide a neutral backdrop that highlights the projects.
- Accent color: Soft gold (#F0E68C) to highlight key information and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will create a modern, machined, objective, neutral look that works well for both headlines and body text
- Use a consistent set of simple, line-based icons to represent project categories and technologies.
- Implement a clean, responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback and guide the user through the site (e.g., a smooth scroll to project details).
